Many compilers do some of their work by means of correctness-preserving, and hopefully performance-improving, program transformations. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) takes this idea of "compilation by transformation" as its war-cry, trying to express as much as possible of the compilation process in the form of program transformations.

This paper reports on our practical experience of the transformational approach to compilation, in the context of a substantial compiler.

We define an underlying type of de Bruijn terms, define an operation of named lambda-abstraction, and hence inductively define a set of conventional name-carrying terms. The result is a mechanisation of the practice of most authors studying formal calculi: to work with conventional name-carrying notation and substitution, but to identify terms up to alpha-conversion. This strategy falls between most previous works, which either treat bound variable names literally or dispense with them altogether. The theory has been implemented in the Cambridge HOL system and used in an experimental application.},

  abstract = {There are two approaches to formalizing the syntax of typed object languages in a proof assistant or programming language. The extrinsic approach is to first define a type that encodes untyped object expressions and then make a separate definition of typing judgements over the untyped terms. The intrinsic approach is to make a single definition that captures well-typed object expressions, so ill-typed expressions cannot even be expressed. Intrinsic encodings are attractive and naturally enforce the requirement that metalanguage operations on object expressions, such as substitution, respect object types. The price is that the metalanguage types of intrinsic encodings and operations involve non-trivial dependency, adding significant complexity. This paper describes intrinsic-style formalizations of both simply-typed and polymorphic languages, and basic syntactic operations thereon, in the Coq proof assistant. The Coq types encoding object-level variables (de Bruijn indices) and terms are indexed by both type and typing environment. One key construction is the boot-strapping of definitions and lemmas about the action of substitutions in terms of similar ones for a simpler notion of renamings. In the simply-typed case, this yields definitions that are free of any use of type equality coercions. In the polymorphic case, some substitution operations do still require type coercions, which we at least partially tame by uniform use of heterogeneous equality.},

Pure LEAP is an extension of the $\omega$-order polymorphic $\lambda$-calculus (F$\omega$) by global definitions that allows the representation of programs and the definition of versions of reify, reflect, and eval for all of (F$\omega$). Pure LEAP is therefore highly reflexive and strongly typed. We believe that Pure LEAP can be extended to a practical and efficient metalanguage in the ML tradition. At present we are experimenting with a prototype implementation of Pure LEAP.},
